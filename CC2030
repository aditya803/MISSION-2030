<h1>CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL</h1>
    <p>(CNN)Twenty days of lethal heat per year. Collapsed eco-syste ms. And more than one billion people displaced.<br/>Those are all probable scenarios that could devastate societies by 2050 if swift and dramatic action isn't taken to curb climate change, according to a think tank report backed by a former Australian military chief.</p>
    <p>The paper, by the Melbourne-based Breakthrough National Center for Climate Restoration, is not a scientific study, but an attempt to model future scenarios based on existing research.<br/>It paints a bleak future in which more than a billion people are displaced, food production drops off and some of the world's most populous cities are left partially abandoned.</p>
    <p>Its foreword is written by Chris Barrie, a retired admiral and former head of the Australian Defense Force, who said that "after nuclear war, human-induced global warming is the greatest threat to human life on the planet."</p>

<h2>THE IMPACT OF 1.5 DEGREE CELCIUS OF GLOBAL WARMING</h2>      
    
    <p><em>"A doomsday future is not inevitable.But without immediate drastic action our prospects are poor."</em><br/>
Andrew King, a climate science lecturer at the University of Melbourne who was not involved in the report, said its findings were "plausible," although he did not expect human civilization to end in 2050.</p>    
<p>"Without a doubt (climate change) is a huge threat to human civilization," he said. "It's the details that we need to pin down."
King said that while he expected all of the issues mentioned in the paper to be occurring by 2050 -- such as displacement of people and food shortages -- it remained to be seen how widespread they would be.</p>
<p>He noted that there were many factors aside from climate change that could have an impact on global security and how humans react to altered conditions, such as population growth and inter-governmental action.</p>
